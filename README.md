## Function and General Overview
Our project, titled **BookMyNanny**, is a full-stack application designed to bridge the gap between parents and potential nannies. With the growing demand for trusted child-care services, our platform aims to provide a reliable space where parents can discover, interact with, and hire nannies based on multiple criteria. Our platform emphasizes the convenience of location-based searches, affordability through clear hourly rates, and trust via a comprehensive review and rating system.

With an in-built messaging system, parents and nannies can communicate effortlessly, ensuring clarity in requirements and schedules. Our initial payment system offers straightforward transactions using hardcoded logic for card-based payments. As an enhancement, we aim to integrate the Stripe payment gateway if time permits, further elevating the user experience for both parents and nannies.

## Course Technologies & Their Uses

1. **React:** React will serve as the backbone of our front-end development. It will be used to create a single-page application and reusable UI components that will be included on our pages.
   
2. **Firebase:** Firebase authentication will be pivotal in user management. By offering options to log in or sign up using email IDs, Google, and Facebook, we aim to cater to a broader audience, ensuring security and a personalized user experience.

3. **Redis:** Redis, an in-memory data structure store, will be used for caching purposes. It will optimize our platform's performance, ensuring faster data retrieval, and reduced database load.
   
4. **GraphQL:** GraphQL will manage and query our data. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL allows for precise data retrieval. It will enable intricate data structures to be fetched seamlessly, such as nanny listings with associated ratings and reviews.
